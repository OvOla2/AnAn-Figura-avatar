The base model has been completed and is available for download in the releases section. This version does not include any effects (suffix: basemodel).

Character models with action animations are currently in production and will be released subsequently (suffix: fullmodel).

Implement animation effects making use of [JimmyAnims](https://github.com/JimmyHelp/JimmyAnims).In the future, more third-party Lua APIs may be utilized to achieve animations.
